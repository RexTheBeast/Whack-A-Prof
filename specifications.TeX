% ====================== 4  SYSTEM FEATURES =================================
\chapter{System Features}

\section{Gameplay and Scoring Mechanics}

\subsection{Description}
A fast-paced game in which doors open at random and reveal professors. Players hit them to earn points; an on-screen score updates immediately. Top scores persist locally.

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Start game: default at 0 points
  \item User selects a weapon
  \item Door opens; professor character appears.
  \item Player clicks / taps character.
  \item Game increments score.
  \item Successful hit: +10 points.
  \item Miss or inactivity: –5 points.
  \item Trustee student character triggers a brief explosion animation when hit($\approx$ 1 second and -10 points).
  \item Game ends: when the score reaches below 0 or when the exit/end icon is activated by the user. A game over box will display, user can choose to go home or play again.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{REQ-1.1}: Characters appear at uniformly random intervals of 0.5–1.5 s.
  \item \textbf{REQ-1.2}: Trustee explosion animation must visibly overlay the screen for $\approx$ 1 s and play an accompanying scream sound effect.
  \item \textbf{REQ-1.3}: Characters vanish after 2 s if not clicked.
  \item \textbf{REQ-2.1}: Score updates in real-time and after each interaction.
  \item \textbf{REQ-2.2}: Top scores are stored via Local Storage.
  \item \textbf{REQ-2.3}: Sound effect (weapon specific) plays on character hits, misses, and trustee hits. Specific sound to be determined during implementation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Audio and Sound Effects}

\subsection{Description}
The game implements a comprehensive sound system to provide audio feedback for game events and enhance the user experience. All sounds follow a consistent style that matches the game's lighthearted theme.

\subsection{Stimulus/Response Sequences}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Game start: Plays introductory sound.
  \item Professor hit: Plays "hit" sound.
  \item Miss: Plays "miss" sound.
  \item Trustee hit: Plays unique "explosion" sound with scream effect.
  \item Game over: Plays concluding sound.
  \item New high score: Plays celebratory sound.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{REQ-3.1}: Game must provide audio feedback for all major user interactions and game events.
  \item \textbf{REQ-3.2}: Distinct sounds must play for:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Game start
      \item Weapon selection
      \item Successful professor hits
      \item Missed attempts
      \item Trustee character hits (unique explosion sound)
      \item Game over
      \item Achievement of new high score
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{REQ-3.3}: Sound effects must synchronize with their corresponding visual events with latency $\leq$ 50 ms.
  \item \textbf{REQ-3.4}: Game must include a mute/unmute toggle button that persists user preference across sessions via Local Storage.
  \item \textbf{REQ-3.5}: Volume level must be consistent across all sound effects to prevent unexpected loud sounds.
\end{itemize}
